## Nanoliob roadmap
### In no particular order (for now)

1. #### pool allocator written in C
   - Good examples so far
     - in C, seems [simple but workable](https://github.com/jobtalle/pool) 
     - can be used as a key building block
   - [C++, but clean](https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool) 
     - (beacuse it is not "modern" )
